# Metro Lines

Cairo Metro consists of three lines, each identified by a color. Here are the details of each line:

## Line 1 (Red Line)

The Red Line is the oldest and longest metro line in Cairo. It runs from northwest to southeast, connecting Helwan in the south with Al-Marg in the northeast. The line passes through major stations such as Sadat, Attaba, and Nasser. Line 1 is particularly useful for reaching downtown Cairo and central locations.

## Line 2 (Green Line)

The Green Line runs from east to west, connecting Shubra El-Kheima in the north with Giza in the south. This line intersects with Line 1 at multiple stations, including Sadat and Attaba. Line 2 is convenient for reaching popular destinations such as the Egyptian Museum and the Pyramids of Giza.

## Line 3 (Blue Line)

The Blue Line is the newest addition to the Cairo Metro system. It runs from the northwest part of the city, from Attaba, to the northeast, ending at Cairo International Airport. Line 3 provides a direct link to the airport, making it a convenient option for travelers.
